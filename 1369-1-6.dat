;equipment=Light purple rock in right eye socket.;picture=mrap07.jpg\
;characteristics=A silver tabby - a common British cat with tortoise-shell\
 blotches of light and dark gray instead of stripes.  His left ear is half\
 missing, except for a little scrap of flesh that sort of dangles off of the\
 remaining half.  Running along the right side of his face are three parallel\
 scars (probably claw induced, but it was a big claw) that run through where\
 his right eye used to be.  In the place of his eye is what looks like a pale\
 purpleish stone, like something you'd find in a riverbed and keep for about an\
 hour because it was pretty. Pale purple doesn't go with his fur.  Speaking\
 of it's fur, big patches are missing, exposing red, flaking skin.  His right\
 front paw is missing, and it obviously healed without medical attention.  His\
 remaining eye is a bloodshot yellow.  It smells faintly of piss and beer.\
 If tressym can be judged by wingless cat standards, this one probably counts\
 as old and scrawny.;note=He joined the party on <d Kythorn 29 1369>.  He\
 drinks an amazing amount of booze.
