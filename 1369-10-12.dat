;fullname=Gomsha of Other Tusk Mountain;picture=skull250o.png\
;characteristics=9/4/1357 - 12/1/1369;note=\
<p>A Mountain Orc of the Other Tusk Clan, Gomsha was most noted amoung her\
 community for the interesting patterns she would make from loose rocks when\
 the males weren't around to kick them apart and being of child-bearing age.</p>\
\
<p>Gomsha's life took an unexpected turn in early Uktar in the Year of the\
 Gauntlet.  While being escorted to her betrothal ceremony, her party\
 inadvertently triggered a gate created by Halaster, the Mad Mage of\
 Undermountain, that trapped them all within that dungeon.  After wandering\
 the halls of Undermountain for several days and several unfortunate\
 confrontations with other denizens of the dungeon, the band was set upon by\
 a stronger band of goblins who slew the rest of her party and captured\
 Gomsha for a ritual sacrifice. Fortunately for Gomsha, those Goblins were\
 then attacked by AFAL, who slew the goblins and rescued Gomsha. Gomsha was\
 quite taken by Narthandarkanas, a priest of Tempus, and was taken in by the\
 party that had rescued her.</p>\
\
<p>Gomsha's life ended abruptly on <d Nightal 1 1369> when AFAL encountered a\
 band of ogres, minotaurs, and st. elmo's hounds.  The combined breath attacks\
 from the three hounds proved too much for her and she died moments before her\
 comrade in arms, Stewart of Selune, also perished.  Gomsha's remains were\
 buried in the back yard of Fair Winds and a brief ceremony was performed by\
 Narthan.</p>\
\
<p>Gomsha is survived by her fianc&eacute\;, Kurgh of Small Tusk Mountain,\
 twelve of her brothers, Grum, Gack, Urgh, Gurarhrg, Churgh, Breghulg,\
 Nurkhul, G'ack, Gack-ack, Grack, Urghul, and Murgh, seven of her sisters (all\
 Gomsha), her lover, Narthandarkanas nha Kandar of Tempus, and four of her\
 potential fathers, Manghan, Muk, Mugh and Charlagh.  She had three children,\
 none of whom survived to their naming ceremony.</p>
