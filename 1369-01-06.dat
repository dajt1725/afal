;characteristics=1/6/1335 - 12/1/1369;note=\
<p>When he completed his training as a Moon Knight, Stewart of Selune, as he\
 was now known, resumed the wandering that had brought him to the church in the\
 first place, this time to preach the word of Selune in the Savage North.  It\
 was in the North, while travelling through Everlund that he met his fellow\
 priest, Dexter of Selune, and with him became one of the founding members of\
 AFAL.  Stewart was a major contributor to AFAL and continued to serve Selune\
 faithfully, accomplishing the desecration of several temples and shrines of\
 Shar and other evil dieties.  Stewart is perhaps best remembered for his\
 unique charm, his legendary capacity for drink, and his daring confrontation\
 with flying wererats while dangling at the end of a rope on <d Kythorn 15 1369>.</p>\
\
<p>Stewart died in battle in Undermountain on <d Nightal 1 1369>, during an\
 attempt to avenge the honor of a young lady.  Already badly wounded from a\
 brave attack on a demon, Stewart insisted on maintaining his position at the\
 head of the party, where he was felled by the combined breath of three St.\
 Elmo's Hounds and the detonation of the many offensive magic items he bore.\
 His remains were intered at the House of the Moon in Waterdeep and a memorial\
 service was performed on his behalf by his comrade Dexter of Selune.</p>\
\
<p>Nothing is known of Stewart's familly, but he left 1cp each to two\
 Halflings, Reginald and Featherdown Nimblytoes, in his will.</p>

<p>The third child of a well-to-do merchant familly in Sundabar,\
 &quot\;Buffy&quot\;, as her familly called her, stood out amoung her siblings\
 at an early age by virtue of both her beauty and her exceptional intelligence.\
 Although a rift existed between Elizabeth Rose and her father from her early\
 childhood, he nevertheless arranged for her to be apprenticed with the talented\
 enchantress Madame Seluria, where she learned her trade.</p>\
\
<p>At the start of spring in the Year of the Gauntlet, Elizabeth Rose left\
 home in search of her sister Bambi, who had disappeared the year before. At\
 the end of Mirtul she found her sister and met AFAL, whom she decided to join\
 to look after Bambi.</p>\
\
<p>Buffy met her end in a forgotten temple of Shar on <d Flamerule 23 1369>,\
 which her party was exploring. While trying to antagonize a piece of\
 statuary that he believed to be a monster, Henkles inadvertently set off an\
 explosion that injured half party and killed Elizabeth Rose instantly. Her\
 body was recovered and a moonlight funeral service was performed by Dexter\
 of Selune on <d Eleasias 4 1369>.</p>\
\
<p>Buffy is survived by her father, Bruno, her mother, Betty, her three\
 brothers, Billy Bob, Bart and Bruce, her two sisters Rebecka &quot\;Becky&quot\;\
 Iris and Bambi, and her brother-in-law Son of Moogh.</p>

;equipment=Light purple rock in right eye socket.;picture=mrap07.jpg\
;characteristics=A silver tabby - a common British cat with tortoise-shell\
 blotches of light and dark gray instead of stripes.  His left ear is half\
 missing, except for a little scrap of flesh that sort of dangles off of the\
 remaining half.  Running along the right side of his face are three parallel\
 scars (probably claw induced, but it was a big claw) that run through where\
 his right eye used to be.  In the place of his eye is what looks like a pale\
 purpleish stone, like something you'd find in a riverbed and keep for about an\
 hour because it was pretty. Pale purple doesn't go with his fur.  Speaking\
 of it's fur, big patches are missing, exposing red, flaking skin.  His right\
 front paw is missing, and it obviously healed without medical attention.  His\
 remaining eye is a bloodshot yellow.  It smells faintly of piss and beer.\
 If tressym can be judged by wingless cat standards, this one probably counts\
 as old and scrawny.;note=He joined the party on <d Kythorn 29 1369>.  He\
 drinks an amazing amount of booze.
