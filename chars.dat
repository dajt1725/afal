 scars (probably claw induced, but it was a big claw) that run through where\
 his right eye used to be.  In the place of his eye is what looks like a pale\
 purpleish stone, like something you'd find in a riverbed and keep for about an\
 hour because it was pretty. Pale purple doesn't go with his fur.  Speaking\
 of it's fur, big patches are missing, exposing red, flaking skin.  His right\
 front paw is missing, and it obviously healed without medical attention.  His\
 remaining eye is a bloodshot yellow.  It smells faintly of piss and beer.\
